# Project Goals

The goal of the Oureyes project is to provide enhanced convenience and assistance to individuals with disabilities. The intelligent eyewear, Oureyes, utilizes the M2 Max chip and features two cameras (alpha Camera and beta Camera) and an ultrasonic rangefinder, enabling stereoscopic vision and depth perception. Additionally, it includes a speaker for audio output and supports Bluetooth connectivity for data transfer and control with other devices.

Based on these functionalities, Oureyes aims to provide the following assistance to individuals with disabilities:

Stereoscopic vision and depth perception: For individuals with visual impairments, stereoscopic vision and depth perception can provide additional visual information, helping them better understand their surroundings.

Audio output: Oureyes features a speaker that can output sound, benefiting individuals with language barriers. They can communicate with the intelligent eyewear through text or voice input.

Bluetooth connectivity: Oureyes supports Bluetooth connectivity, allowing individuals with disabilities to connect to other devices such as smartphones or computers for extended functionality and communication. Additionally, Oureyes can stay connected to the Internet to access real-time information (e.g., NBA game results) and can use Bluetooth capabilities to send commands to smartphones for setting alarms, among other functions.

ADA, as a voice AI system based on knowledge representation and reasoning technology, can provide efficient and accurate knowledge consultation and problem-solving solutions to users. This integration further enhances the practicality and efficiency of the intelligent eyewear. Consequently, Oureyes can help individuals with disabilities better integrate into society, improving their quality of life and autonomy.

In terms of computing resources, Oureyes can be powered by a Raspberry Pi, which provides sufficient processing power for most tasks. However, for more computationally intensive operations or when additional processing capabilities are required, the intelligent eyewear can seamlessly transfer the computations to the developer's computer, equipped with advanced hardware such as the M2 Max chip. This allows for more complex analyses and computations to be performed, ensuring optimal performance and functionality.

Overall, Oureyes offers significant benefits to individuals with disabilities, providing them with enhanced convenience and assistance to better navigate their daily lives. The combination of Raspberry Pi and the developer's computer ensures a balance between portability and computational power, allowing for a versatile and efficient user experience.
